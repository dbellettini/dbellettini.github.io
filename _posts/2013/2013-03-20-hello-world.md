First of all, thanks **[@yoghi](https://twitter.com/yoghi)** for letting me know
about Jekyll Bootstrap, this is a cool way to manage a web site on GitHub.
**Thank you** to Jekyll Bootstrap and Twitter bootstrap authors and
contributors too!

In next post I will talk about [UniversiBO](https://github.com/UniversiBO) which 
is the biggest project I've been been involved in.

Thank you for reading and see you soon!

Cheers!

Davide
